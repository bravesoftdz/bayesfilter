Apple planning new iMac for 2017 and 'completely rethinking' Mac Pro

Apple has taken the rare step of pre-announcing major new products, confirming
that it will release new iMacs later this year and a “completely rethought Mac
The company also apologised to Mac Pro users for the neglect of the product
line, which has gone three years without an update.
First released in December 2013, the Mac Pro represented a radical redesign of
the company’s highest-powered machine. A sleek black cylinder, it was designed
to create minimal noise while cooling its interior, and intended to be expanded
largely with external peripherals through six Thunderbolt 2 ports. But Craig
Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said that the
design had eventually ended up tying Apple’s hands when it came to replace the
“I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will,” he
told Apple blogger John Gruber. “We designed a system with the kind of GPUs
that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve
with a two GPU architecture. That that was the thermal limit we needed, or the
thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn’t materialise to fit that as
“Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture
and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate,”
Federighi added. “So it became fairly difficult to adjust.”
Faced with the possibility of remaining silent for at least another year,
compounding impressions that the company had abandoned pro users, Apple took
the rare decision to instead pre-announce the update to the Mac line.
Typically, Apple is firmly tight-lipped about updates until they are ready for
Beyond its existence, and the fact that it won’t arrive in 2017, Apple didn’t
share much else about the new Mac Pro. Phil Schiller, the company’s senior vice
president of worldwide marketing, said: “We have a team working hard on it
right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with
regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end,
high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding Pro customers.”
Schiller also confirmed that a new Pro monitor would be coming alongside the
In the shorter term, Schiller confirmed that Apple is working on an update to
the iMac, still the computer used by the majority of Apple desktop users,
including the majority of professional users. “We have big plans for the iMac,”
he said. “We’re going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with
“The iMac has seen an incredible evolution over the past decade,” Federighi
added. “The original iMac you wouldn’t have thought of as remotely touching Pro
uses. But today’s 5K iMac in its top configurations? It’s incredibly powerful.
Tasks that previously would have required the Mac Pros of old are now being
As for those users who need a new Mac Pro now, and can’t wait, the company has
given the old machine a mild spec bump. The £2,999 entry level configuration
will now have the specs previously given to the £3,899 model, while that more
