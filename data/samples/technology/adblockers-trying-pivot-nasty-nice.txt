From nasty to nice: how adblockers are trying to pivot
Controversial software was branded enemy of publishers, but adblocker

Adblocking, for a long time used quietly by tech-savvy desktop surfers,
exploded into the public consciousness in 2015 when Apple allowed content
For a while, it looked like a war was in the offing: adblocker developers
argued that ad-supported media on the net was abusing its readers, while
publishers argued that blocking ads was tantamount to theft. Both sides
experimented with blocks and counter-blocks, culminating in sites simply
But 18 months on, the landscape has changed. Facebook and Google’s share of
digital advertising has continued to rocket, even as every other provider has
flatlined. Meanwhile, market penetration of adblockers has plateaued (Britain’s
IAB estimates 22% of visitors block ads, the same as this time last year). And
as well as fighting back technologically, some sites have started appealing to
the morality of visitors, pointing out that blocking adverts deprives
publishers of revenue, and requesting adblocking readers whitelist their
It’s not just publishers who have started to push themselves as the moral
option, however. Developers of adblockers have been reassessing their own
relationship to publishing, and bringing out products intended to ameliorate
for the loss of revenue site owners experience from adblocking.
Recently, Adblock Plus, one of the largest desktop adblockers, made a decisive
move into this space, buying microdonation platform Flattr for an undisclosed
First launched in 2010, Flattr’s goal has always been to provide an alternative
revenue model to ad-supported media. The service allows site owners to load a
digital tip jar on their content, which Flattr users can click to thank
creators. Each month, Flattr bills users a recurring amount, which is then
Although its heart was in the right place, Flattr struggled to overcome the
network effects inherent in its model: publishers wouldn’t bother supporting it
if there weren’t enough readers paying in, and readers wouldn’t pay in if their
So a partnership with Adblock Plus made sense, and in May last year the two
companies announced they’d be working together to create Flattr Plus, removing
the need to click a button to distribute tips and instead automatically funding
publishers based on engagement, as an alternative to advertising.
That partnership has been solidified further with the merger between the two
companies: Adblock Plus now owns both the carrot and the stick.
Not every publisher’s adverts get blocked by Adblock Plus, though. The
controversial “acceptable ads” programme allows companies which think they have
unintrusive adverts to apply to be whitelisted. Larger companies pay for the
privilege, with Google, Microsoft and Amazon handing over huge sums based on
the number of views which would otherwise be blocked. That’s led to allegations
that the ads programme constitutes a shakedown of sorts, which Flattr Plus does
Other adblock companies are taking a similar approach to finding a middle way
but without the requests for direct payments from publishers. Brave is one of
the most notable attempts: it’s whole new browser, founded by former Firefox
Taking on Google on two fronts at once is a bold move, but Brave hopes to both
outcompete Chrome as a browser while also blocking the adverts and tracking
scripts that provide Google with the bulk of its revenue. Its pitch to users is
the same as many adblockers, particularly mobile ones: by stripping out some
content, loading times can be improved by “up to 60%”, privacy can be
protected, and the web becomes a more pleasant experience for all.
Like Adblock Plus, Brave wants to help publishers in other ways. Users can pay
a certain monthly fee which is distributed using bitcoin to the sites you
visit, in proportion to how much you visit them. Unlike Flattr, Brave itself
doesn’t know which sites the user visits (a handy advantage for a browser
selling itself on privacy). Both services do still open themselves up to
criticism from the publishers on whose behalf money is being collected,
however; Brave, for instance, doesn’t even tell a site owner that it’s been
collecting cash until $100 is in the bank, and is currently only able to
actually pay out to those publishers who own the domain name they’re publishing
on – cold comfort for YouTube creators, for instance, whose adverts, and ad
Perhaps the most interesting move to a more moral adblocking has come from
Shine, an adblock company which struck a deal with mobile operator Three in
2016 to introduce adblocking across the entire network. Unlike traditional
adblockers, the move would have let adverts be blocked at a network level,
rendering it nearly impossible for companies to bypass, and allowing adverts to
be blocked even in-app, where most mobile adblockers have no sway.
But in February this year, Shine had a change of heart. The company rebranded
as Rainbow, and announced a new goal: fixing advertising at both ends of the
industry. It will still sit at the top level, but rather than blocking all
adverts, its plan now is to use that privileged access to allow advertisers to
more accurately and precisely target users, while letting users ensure that
obtrusive, annoying or exploitative adverts don’t make it on to their devices.
Make no mistake: Rainbow will still be blocking some ads for users who opt-in
to its service. Ad networks which refuse to work with them, and which break the
advertising “bill of rights” that Rainbow enforces, will see the offending ads
blocked. But unlike Adblock Plus, the company doesn’t charge behaving
advertisers to get through; and unlike Brave, it doesn’t declare the ad-funded
internet dead while dealing the killing blow itself.
But someone has to pay the piper. Rainbow’s plan is to take advantage of its
position near the networks to build up an unassailable amount of data on how
users interact with adverts and advertisers, and sell that on. For users who
dislike adverts simply because they’re ugly or obtrusive, it could be perfect.
For those who call for privacy from advertising trackers, the cure may be as
