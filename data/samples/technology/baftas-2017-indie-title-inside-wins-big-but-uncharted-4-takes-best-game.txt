Baftas 2017: indie Inside wins big but Uncharted 4 takes best game
Playdead’s Inside picked up four awards as indie developers outshone major

At last year’s Bafta Game Awards, the developer of Her Story, Sam Barlow,
famously so struggled with his three awards that he carried them around in a
champagne bucket. This year, indie developer Playdead went one better by
winning four for their dystopian puzzle platformer Inside: artistic
achievement, game design, narrative, and original property.
After their previous game, Limbo, won none from four in 2011, the team at
Playdead were delighted to take home so many this year: “We kind of expected to
Inside just missed out on the award for best game which went to Uncharted 4,
continuing a tradition of big-budget titles walking away with the top prize
(Fallout 4 in 2016 and Destiny in 2015). It was the second best game win in
five years for Uncharted 4’s developer Naughty Dog after The Last of Us won in
2013. On stage, Naughty Dog director of communications Arne Meyer thanked the
cast of voice actors including Nolan North (Nathan Drake), Emily Rose (Elena
Fisher), and Troy Baker (Sam Drake) – but none of them took home the award for
That honour went to Cissy Jones, the voice of Delilah in Firewatch, which also
won the award for debut game. Jones appeared to fight back tears as she thanked
Bafta for “recognising everything that goes into the video game industry”.
After the ceremony she was still in shock: “I can’t even. I feel like I’m in a
“Bafta raises the bar,” she said. “I mean, look at this event. There is nothing
like this anywhere. I mean, getting game devs in tuxes, come on guys. They make
it something that is not only mainstream but it’s acceptable. Everyone wants to
The team behind autobiographical game That Dragon, Cancer, which won the award
for game innovation, also praised Bafta for accepting video games. Composer Jon
Hillman referred to the speech given by Brenda Romero, who accepted the special
award: “It’s the most prestigious award ceremony there is in games. Brenda was
just saying that it made games art. They’ve accepted it as art. I think that’s
what they’re doing. They’re elevating games to that level,” he said.
Writer Amy Green said after the win: “We’d love to see more stories made by
people who are just desperate to tell people what it’s like to be them in this
The award for British game went to Overcooked, which also won the family
category, apparently to the surprise of the developers, who admitted to not
having prepared a speech in either case. Perhaps they thought British game
would go instead to the more artsy Virginia, which ended up with just one award
for music. The audience cheered as composer Lyndon Holland shyly thanked his
Other winners included The Last Guardian for audio achievement, Rocket League
for evolving game, Overwatch for multiplayer, and last summer’s huge success
