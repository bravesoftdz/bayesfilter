Ever heard of a “MacBook selfie stick”? How about Tinder VR goggles? What about
a salmon phone? These are the innovations of two digital artists Tom Galle and
Moises Sanabria, whose Instagram accounts showcase their take on new tech and
how it’s affecting us. Tom and Moises speak to Leigh about how their work has
gone viral, their take on meme subcultures, and why their work is different
Leigh Alexander also speaks to producer Iain Chambers about his continued use
of the Nokia C1 as a means of creating oil paintings, and his group Langham
Research Centre, who use obsolete analogue technology to make new music.
