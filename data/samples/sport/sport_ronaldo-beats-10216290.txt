Real Madrid post animation celebrating Ronaldo's 100 European goals
Cristiano Ronaldo's brace to beat Lionel Messi to 100 goals in European
football came against a "wall" in Bayern Munich keeper Manuel Neuer, says
The Portuguese superstar scored his 99th and 100th goals in Real Madrid's
comeback Champions League quarter-final first-leg win.
Bayern and Germany keeper Neuer made strong saves from Ronaldo and Gareth Bale
in a total of 10 for the match in a standout performance, so it seemed
unfortunate that the landmark winner went through his legs.
It was Arturo Vidal who opened the scoring with a blistering header in the 25th
minute but he turned villain when he missed a penalty controversially awarded

Ronaldo's volley brought the 47th-minute equaliser before he met Marco Asenio's
pinpoint cross for the winner with 13 minutes to go.
It landed four-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo yet another major milestone with
his rival Messi lagging on 97 goals in UEFA competitions.
Of his 100, 16 came for Manchester United before his move in 2009 to the
Bernabeu, where his most prolific haul for a season came in 2013-14 with 17.

In that time Ronaldo's had a knack of delivering when his team really needs it
After his equaliser, the game turned in Real's favour when Ronaldo was too
quick for Javi Martinez, whose outstretched leg earned him a second yellow and
Zidane isn't getting ahead of himself though ahead of the return leg.
"Winning here isn't easy," said Zidane on beIN Sports. "We suffered a lot in

However, he revealed it was a precautionary measure aimed at keeping the Wales
forward fully fit after his recent injury worries.
"Bale felt a tweak at half-time and I didn't want to take any risks. He doesn't
feel so good, we hope it's nothing major," he said.
Bayern Munich coach Carlo Ancelotti assured fans his side are still very much
in the hunt to stop Real's bid to be the first side to defend the Champions
"We're still alive, we're not dead," the Italian said.
"Real have the better chance now but we still have a chance too, and we'll play
