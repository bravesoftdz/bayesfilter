Golf's most iconic major is over for another year, with Sergio Garcia finally
The Spaniard joins countrymen and jacket holders Seve Ballesteros and Jose'
Mari'a Olaza'bal in Masters history, winning the tournament on what would've
But what did we learn from the 81st edition of the Masters?
Fred Couples showed that even at the tender age of 57 he can still compete with
Tied for 18th position, Couples (+1) finished above the likes of Jason Day
(+2), Phil Mickelson (+2), Henrik Stenson (+8) and was only three shots behind

The 1992 Masters champion shot 73, 70, 74, 72, with an impressive two-under par
score in the second round. Not bad for a player ranked 1893 in the world
Playing his 32nd Masters tournament, Couples showed you should never
2. Rickie Fowler still doesn't have what it takes to win a major
Fowler went into the fourth round only one shot behind the European pair of
At five-under par many were questioning whether it was the young Californian's
With the American patriots dreaming of a return of the green jacket to an
American, after Englishman Danny Willett took it from Jordan Spieth last year,
A disappointing four-over par final round saw the 28-year-old finish outside of
the top 10. It was a similar story for Fowler three years ago, when he was two
shots behind fellow Americans Jordan Spieth and Bubba Watson going into the

A one-over par final round saw Fowler finish six shots behind champion Watson
in fifth place. In the same year, a similar scenario. In the 2014 PGA
Championship, the eccentric golfer was again two shots behind leader Rory
McIlroy, but was unable to match the Northern Irishman, finishing two shots off
It's a question of when not if Fowler wins his first major, but for the time
After the Spaniard's third-round collapse at Augusta in 2012, Garcia claimed
that he wasn't good enough to win a major. With 12 top-five finishes before his
long-awaited Masters triumph on Sunday, it looked to the golfing world that
Two second-placed finishes in both The Open Championship and the PGA
Championship and a third place finish in the U.S. Open, it had been close but

But at long last Garcia proved everyone in the golfing world wrong and clinched
the green jacket after a final-round battle of David and Goliath proportions.
Garcia beat the 2013 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose in a tense play-off,
showing everyone why the Masters is the most revered tournament in the golfing
4. World rankings mean nothing when it comes to the Masters
Ranked 11th in the world rankings going into the tournament, Sergio Garcia
continued the trend of golfers starting the tournament outside of the top ten
From the last ten Masters winners only three have been from inside the top ten
in the world rankings, heading into Augusta weekend. Only Jordan Spieth in
2015, Adam Scott in 2013 and Phil Mickelson in 2010 left as champions having
Last 10 Masters winners and their world ranking going into the Masters:
Phil Mickelson is the highest-ranked Masters winner from the last 10 years 
The latest instalment of the Masters was not just a gripping spectacle, it was
also an advert for great sportsmanship; with champion Garcia and runner-up Rose
Throughout the final round you could be forgiven for forgetting the stakes, as
the European duo continued to show what sport is all about. Excellent golf
mixed with equally good sportsmanship put other sports to shame.

The pair could be seen high-fiving and praising each other after every good
shot, with commiserations following the not-so-good ones.
Gracious in defeat, Rose spoke of his friendship with champion Garcia following
their play-off: "We have a great friendship and a good rivalry. It is good for
him to have the monkey off his back and I am very pleased for him." the
From gracious in defeat to humble in victory, Garcia dedicated his win to
Olaza'bal and the late Ballesteros: “To be able to join him (Olaza'bal) and
Seve (Ballesteros) as Masters champions from Spain, it’s unbelievable.”
With the Masters over for another year, the countdown starts until the U.S.
