UKAD investigates claim Team Sky may have breached 'no needles' policy to aid

UK Anti-Doping is investigating an allegation that Team Sky injected some of
its riders with Fluimucil and other substances to aid recovery even after
cycling's world governing body banned needles at races in 2011.
None of the substances are illegal under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules
but there are concerns about the ethics of administering them intravenously and
the possibility that Team Sky may have breached the 'no needles' policy adopted
Fluimucil is a brand name of acetylcysteine, an amino acid important in the
synthesis of glutathione, a muscle anti-oxidant that aids recovery. Also used
as a decongestant, it is at the heart of the controversy about a mystery
package delivered to Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman at the end of the

Former Team Sky doctor, Richard Freeman, has been accused of continuing to give

Dr Freeman claims the package, which was couriered from Manchester to France by
a British Cycling employee, contained Fluimucil and that he gave it to star
rider Sir Bradley Wiggins via a nebuliser to clear his airways.
But a whistle-blower has sent information to the House of Commons' Culture,
Media and Sport select committee and UKAD that some Team Sky doctors were using
intravenous recovery methods towards the end of the team's difficult first
season in 2010 and continued to do so despite the UCI ban, which Team Sky

So-called 'IV recovery' was common in cycling a decade ago as it was believed
infusions or injections of substances that repair tissue damage and replace
lost nutrients were almost essential, particularly in stage races.
For example, Team Sky's current star Chris Froome told the Irish Independent in
2014 he had been injected with Fluimucil when he was with former team
Barloworld in 2008 and 2009. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on

Team Sky revealed they sourced Fluimucil from Swiss pharmacy

Team Sky revealed they sourced Fluimucil, given to Sir Bradley Wiggins, from
'Fluimucil is an effective mucolytic which helps to get rid of sticky and thick
mucus that is obstructing the airway, resulting in coughing.' 
'Fluimucil contains the active ingredient N-acetylcysteine, which is a
Glutathione precursor and has direct action on the mucus structure.'
The source, who is understood to have worked for Team Sky, has provided UKAD
and the select committee's chairman Damian Collins with evidence that some Team
Sky riders were even injected with Tationil, a glutathione commonly used to
The source has claimed Team Sky hired Dr Fabio Bartalucci in late 2010 after
senior riders complained the British team's desire to break with cycling's
troubled past and be beyond suspicion was affecting results, as Dr Bartalucci
Some members of staff are understood to have objected to the decision to bring
in Dr Bartalucci, who was picked up by police in an anti-doping raid at the
2001 Giro d'Italia but not charged, and the Italian did not stay with Team Sky
for long after the UCI needles ban came in. One of the team's original doctors,
David Hulse, left the team unhappy about the change of policy on IV recovery.
The source, however, has claimed Dr Freeman continued to give some riders
injections but not during races, so there is no obvious breach of the UCI's 'no
needles' policy, although the team's record-keeping has already been proven to
be lax so it would be hard to prove or disprove how close to the start of races

From May 2011, the UCI prohibited any injection - unless there is a diagnosed
condition with no alternative treatment - within two days of a race and then
Team Sky have been under the microscope ever since Russian hackers revealed in
September that Wiggins was given special dispensation - known as a therapeutic
use exemption (TUE) - for injections of triamcinolone before his three main
races in 2011, 2012 and 2013, including the historic 2012 Tour de France win.
Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid that has been abused by dopers, as it sheds
weight, delays fatigue and aids recovery. Wiggins, however, has said he used it
legitimately to treat a pollen allergy, although he made no mention of this in
his autobiographies and claimed never to have had an injection.
The whistle-blower is understood to have told UKAD they believe the team used

In October, UKAD announced it was investigating 'allegations of wrongdoing',
and its boss Nicole Sapstead confirmed in March the allegation was that the
mystery package delivered to Dr Freeman in 2011 contained triamcinolone and
that it was given to Wiggins straight after his win at the Dauphine. This would
be an anti-doping rule violation as it predates his 2011 TUE, but Freeman and
However, the evidence promised in December by Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford
to prove it was Fluimucil has not materialised as Dr Freeman was not following
team policy by sharing information with colleagues and later lost his records
There are also no records to prove what was in the package at British Cycling's
Manchester base, from where the package was dispatched, and Dr Freeman is still
employed as the GB team's doctor. These failings have been condemned by
