Technology and the internet could fuel a fresh migration surge from developing
countries as robots and automation destroy millions of low-skilled jobs,
Jim Yong Kim said rising broadband access had created a world where "keeping up
with the Jones's" meant those in the developing world were comparing their
While these rising aspirations had led to "dynamism" and "inclusive,
sustainable growth" when accompanied by local opportunities, Mr Kim said it
also risked creating a generation of "frustrated" workers.
He said this scenario could "lead to lots of bad outcomes - fragility, conflict

"The evidence is very good that if you get access to broadband, overall
satisfaction goes up, but the likelihood of wanting to migrate also goes up,
and it goes up pretty dramatically. So seeing how other people live directly
"It used to be that keeping up with the Jones's used to be about keeping up
with your neighbours, but now the Jones's can be everywhere in the world."
Mr Kim said income growth expectations tended to increase as people realised
"Aspirations linked to opportunity leads to dynamism and growth in the economy,
but aspirations linked to lack of opportunity lead to frustration and there's
some very suggestive research that makes us extremely worried.
"As aspirations rise, more and more people get frustrated because the kinds of
jobs that are available - certainly low skilled ones are going to be gone," he
"The traditional path to economic development, where you go from agriculture to
light manufacturing to industrialisation, the path that Korea followed, that
China followed, that so many countries followed, is not going to be open to
"So you're seeing the possibility that if broadband access becomes global
quickly, then you can see reference incomes go up pretty dramatically which
means that it makes our development task much much more urgent."
Mr Kim stressed that technological developments had benefited the global

Mr Kim said global growth was likely to strengthen over the next two years amid
a brighter outlook in advanced and emerging economies.
He said there were “bright signs” appearing around the world as emerging
markets recover from a commodity slump and growth in Europe shows signs of
The World Bank chief also said he was “encouraged” by his conversations with
President Donald Trump, despite signs that support for international financial
institutions like the the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are
Mr Kim added that “question marks” remained over the direction of the US
economy under Mr Trump, even though world growth, which is forecast at 2.7pc
The World Bank predicted growth of 2.9pc next year at its most recent forecast
Mr Kim said the outlook would be influenced by tax and spending decisions made
by Mr Trump, noting that the “exuberance” displayed by markets and economic
surveys in the wake of his election victory has been tempered in recent weeks.

“With US growth there’s still a question mark. There was a lot of exuberance at
first and it’s a bit tempered now. But if Mr Trump is serious about investments
in infrastructure - I know they’re having very in depth discussions about just
how to do that - you can see the US continuing to perform.” 
He said the European Union was also “doing better”, even as Brexit was likely
 In a separate speech at the London School of Economics last night, Mr Kim said
organisations like the World Bank had to do more to encourage private sector
investment and not “crowd out” finance from businesses and individuals.

help to foster ambitious goals to create more jobs, boost growth and ensure low

However, Mr Kim, who has met with Mr Trump as well as his advisers, including
Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs chief, said: “They’re very interested in
the possibility of working with us on issues that they care about. 
“We’ve been really encouraged by our conversations with the Trump
administration, so we’ll see what happens. I don’t think you really know what
