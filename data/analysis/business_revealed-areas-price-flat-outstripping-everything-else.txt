Revealed: The areas where the price of a flat is outstripping everything else
The cost of flats and maisonettes is rising at a faster rate than any other
property type according to the Land Registry's latest House Price Index
On an annual basis house price growth picked up slightly in February according
to the index with prices rising by 5.8pc in the year to February, up from 5.3pc

in February 2016. This continued rise in prices is due to a crunch on supply. 
Nicholas Finn, executive director of Garrington Property Finders, said: “The
gently increasing rate of price growth is welcome – but no one should confuse

a flat or maisonette in England now stands significantly higher - at £220,493 -
than the average semi-detached property, worth £211,341.
However, when examined on a more granular geographic level the figures show
that flats are setting the pace in the vast majority of the country.
The cost of a flat is rising faster than detached, semi-detached and terraced
houses in every one of the UK's regions and in 320 of 379 local authority areas

in the year to February, an increase four percentage points higher than that

their second most disproportionate rate in Greenwich. Kensington and Chelsea is

have faith in the estimate that house prices rose briskly in February, given
repeated downward revisions to the first estimates in previous months.”

also increased by 7pc in February compared to the previous month, but this up
