Fred Goodwin in court as 'misleading' RBS faces wrath of shareholders
RBS RBS settled claims with four of the five investor groups in December
Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, will
appear in court at the start of June over allegations that the lender did not
give investors a full picture of its finances at the time of a crunch
Thousands of investors are bringing a civil lawsuit against RBS after buying
shares in a £12bn fundraising at the height of the financial crisis, six months
before the bank had to be rescued in a £45.5bn Government bailout.
Investors lost around 80pc of their money at the time.
RBS settled claims with four of the five investor groups who originally alleged
omissions and misstatements from the lender last December, and last month, it
reportedly increased its settlement offer with the final investor group
bringing charges against it, known as the RBoS Shareholder Action Group. 
This group includes 27,000 private investors, former and current RBS staff and
about 100 institutions. Former RBS vice-chairman Sir Angus Grossart and
Stagecoach founder Sir Brian Souter are among the plaintiffs.
The shareholder group is taking the bank to court for compensation for
allegedly being misled in the run-up to the rights issue.
Mr Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood in 2012 after thousands of job
losses at RBS, is scheduled to give evidence in court on June 8 and 9.
