Thanks for the advice, but no thanks: BHP Billiton dismisses 'flawed' Elliott
BHP Billiton boss Andrew Mackenzie BHP Billiton boss Andrew Mackenzie said
Proposals to break up BHP Billiton are riddled with “major flaws” and could end
up costing far more to implement than they would save, the mining group has
The FTSE 100 company has issued a detailed rebuttal of demands from activist
investor Elliott Adivsors to unify its UK and Australian firms into one and
Andrew Mackenzie, BHP chief executive, said the miner was always “hungry” for
ideas to create value for shareholders but that Elliott’s proposals had “major
flaws” and amounted to little more than “financial engineering”. “It doesn’t
really add the kind of value we believe we can add by running our assets
Under Mr Mackenzie, a former BP executive, BHP has committed to spending more
on oil projects. The chief executive conceded the company was “an unusual
combination of businesses compared to your typical super oil major or
self-contained minerals business” but insisted its oil arm provided clear
“synergies” with its traditional mining core, adding that “petroleum is a good
The US oil business includes onshore shale assets as well as off-shore oil
fields. It contributed to 30pc of BHP’s underlying earnings over the last five
years, but as a standalone entity it would face “higher financing and operating
costs” without the benefit of the miner’s balance sheet, the company said.
In a presentation to shareholders, the Anglo-Australian group warned that
changing its dual-listed structure to one based solely in Australia with a
primary listing in London and a secondary one in Sydney “could destroy at least
$1.3bn in value to save less than US$2.5 million a year - for no identifiable
Elliott Advisors, the UK arm of Paul Singer’s Elliott Management fund,
unleashed its broadside on Monday, claiming that BHP had underperformed its
rivals in recent years. Elliott, which owns 4.1pc of BHP’s London shares, says
its plan could “unlock up to $46bn in value”. Yesterday it branded BHP’s
initial response to its calls “dismissive and premature”.
Much of Elliott’s argument has revolved around unlocking the value of so-called
franking credits, which are tax credits for Australian shareholders. BHP has a
balance of around $9.6bn franking credits, but Peter Beavan, chief financial
officer, said that there were few ways to put these to good use. “There are
schemes folks have come up with [to use franking credits] but the Australian
Tax Office has been clear… it would regard that as avoidance,” he said, adding
that Elliott had not provided a concrete plan for tapping into franking credits
Mr Beavan added that it was “not the right time” to begin large-scale share
buybacks as the company has only just shored up its balance sheet following a
Mr Mackenzie revealed BHP had been in talks with Elliott for eight months prior
to the fund going public with its demands. The miner had had “considerable
dialogue” with other shareholders since the start of this week, he added.
