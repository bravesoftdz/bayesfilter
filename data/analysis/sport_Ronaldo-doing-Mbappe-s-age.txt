If the world hadn't already sat up and noticed Kylian Mbappe, they have now. At
the tender age of 18, the Monaco talent is firing himself to superstardom.
Wednesday night was just the latest man-of-the-match performance from the
Frenchman, as he scored twice to ensure Monaco beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2.
This season he has 19 goals, and is only set to improve as he gets older... but
where were some of the other best players in the world when they were just 18?

When Ronaldo turned 18, he was impressing in the Portuguese top division with
boyhood club Sporting Lisbon, but his life was about to change forever.
After an initial meeting with Arsene Wenger at Arsenal's training ground, Sir
Alex Ferguson set his sights on the winger and he became the world's most
expensive teenager when he moved to Manchester United in the summer of 2003.
Ferguson described Ronaldo as 'one of the most exciting young players I have
ever seen', and he cost United £12m, going on to wear the No 7 shirt at Old

At Mbappe's age, Neymar was still plying his trade in Brazil, a few years
before his big-money move to Barcelona. Santos was the club at which he came
through the ranks, graduating from the academy in 2009.
In his first season Neymar netted 14 goals and just after turning 18 he
returned 42 goals in a mammoth 60-game season. That year, still a teenager with
the world at his feet, he was voted the third best player in South America
behind Andres D'Alessandro and Juan Sebastian Veron.
When he was 18, Santos also rejected bids from West Ham and Chelsea for
Neymar's services... just imagine if one of those had gone through.

Like his countryman Mbappe, Henry was plying his trade at Monaco when he was

is down to the heightened media coverage and the arrival of social media in the
