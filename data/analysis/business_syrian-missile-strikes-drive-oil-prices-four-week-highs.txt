Syrian missile strikes drive oil prices to four-week highs
The US missile strike against Syria has pushed oil prices to a four-week high
of $55.57 a barrel as global markets reacted to heightened geopolitical tension
Crude oil is almost 5pc higher than at the start of the week after four
consecutive days of rising prices and a surge following the US decision to take
military action against the Assad regime on Thursday night.
Shakil Begg, head of oil research at Thomson Reuters, said it was clear
military tensions in the Middle East had ratcheted up prices but warned that
the market may be turning a blind eye to factors that could drive them lower.
“Crude oil rallied on Friday as news that the US launched air strikes against a
Syrian airbase overnight raised concerns the conflict in Syria could spill over
to affect key oil producers in the Middle East,” he said.
“Syria itself has negligible oil production but neighbouring Iraq, and nearby
Iran and Saudi Arabia are key oil suppliers to the global market.”
The price surge comes in spite of signs that US crude supplies are continuing
to grow as higher prices encourage more shale producers to get back into
Oil market analysts have warned that the resurgence of US shale could undermine
the supply cuts agreed by the world’s largest energy suppliers last year in an
historic deal between members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
However, Mr Begg said the perception that the supply deal was helping to remove
“Speculation that global crude supply is tightening has led to firmer prices
this week but Thomson Reuters oil research indicates actual crude shipments
from Opec remain steady with exports for both February and March near levels
since last November, after a seasonal dip in January,” he said.
“Meanwhile, the US reported another build in crude stocks this past week but
the market appears to have taken solace in the continued rise in refinery
demand as we gear up for the summer driving season.”
