The Senate and House have voted to repeal an FCC ruling that protects your
Internet privacy and data from ISPs. Here's all the steps you can take to
protect yourself. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)
After Congress handed President Trump legislation Tuesday that would wipe away 
landmark privacy protections for Internet users, we received a lot of reader
questions about what happens next. The legislation makes it easier for Internet
providers, such as AT&T and Verizon, to collect and sell information such as
your Web browsing history and app usage. But let's get into the details: You
wanted to know whether the measure could help the government dig up dirt on
people. You asked how to protect your privacy. And some of you even asked if it
would be possible to buy up the online browsing histories of Trump or members
To find out, I spoke to a number of privacy and security experts who have been
following these issues closely in the public and the private sectors.
Catch me up real quick. What did Congress vote on?
Congress voted to keep a set of Internet privacy protections approved in
October from taking effect later this year. The rules would have banned
Internet providers from collecting, storing, sharing and selling certain types
of personal information — such as browsing histories, app usage data, location
information and more — without your consent. Trump must still sign the
legislation, but he is widely expected to do so. For more, read our full story
Without these rules, could I really go to an Internet provider and buy a
The short answer is “in theory, but probably not in reality.”
Many Internet service providers (ISPs) have privacy policies that may cover
this type of information. If an ISP shares or sells an individual's personal
information in violation of its own privacy policy, a state attorney general
could take the company to court, said Travis LeBlanc, a former enforcement
bureau chief at the Federal Communications Commission. State attorneys general
could also sue ISPs whose data practices could be construed as “unfair” to
other businesses. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission has said what's left of his agency's privacy authority still allows
him to bring lawsuits against companies — he just won't be able to write rules
that look similar to what Congress rejected this week.
That said, if the providers relax their privacy policies or if the FCC chooses
not to take action, ISPs could conceivably share detailed information about a
person's Web usage that could be used to discover his or her identity.
“You may recall Verizon's supercookie program where they were tracking quite a
bit,” LeBlanc said. “And there were allegations they could share unique data
sets. It may not have said 'Travis LeBlanc,' but it would have been substantial
Based on how companies use and share data today, it's still relatively unlikely
that an ISP would simply hand over data for cash, particularly about an
individual, said Chris Calabrese, policy vice president at the Center for
What generally happens in this industry is that a marketer will ask a company
such as Facebook to advertise with a certain demographic — say, men between the
ages of 45 and 55. The two companies will settle on a deal, and the marketer's
ads will be displayed on Facebook to that group, but the marketing company will
never see specific information about those people, which will continue to be
held by the data company (or in this case, the ISP).
“That's the most likely way you'll have your Web surfing history sold,” said
Calabrese — which means getting the raw data on, say, President Trump could be
harder than you think. For that matter, other legal analysts said, it's not
clear why Internet providers would comply with consumer requests for data on
the politicians that helped ease industry regulations in the first place.
A spokesman for the cable industry said that many Internet providers have
committed to a voluntary set of privacy principles that already limit the
industry's ability to share or sell the data of individuals.
"ISPs haven’t done this to date and don’t plan to because they respect the
privacy of their customers," said Brian Dietz, a spokesman for NCTA — The
Internet & Television Association. "Regardless of the legal status of the FCC’s
broadband privacy rules, we remain committed to protecting our customers’
privacy and safeguarding their information because we value their trust."
If you're looking for ways to enhance your privacy in an era of loosened
regulation, security experts generally recommend several steps.
First, use a virtual private network, or VPN. For a little bit of money, the
best VPNs can hide your true location so that it looks like you're surfing the
Web as somebody else, and encrypt your Internet traffic so that nobody outside
of the VPN can tell what you're looking at. Other tools, such as Tor, mask your
identity by sending your Internet traffic bouncing through a whole bunch of
other intermediary servers before arriving at its destination. Think of it as
the online equivalent of losing a tail in a spy movie. These services are not
cure-alls: They may cause your browsing speeds to drop, and some websites block
VPNs altogether. That includes Netflix, which does this to defeat people who
want to watch videos illegally. Finally, they don't thwart any snooping
software that an Internet provider may have installed on your own device,
Second, make sure that the websites you use take advantage of HTTPS. You can
think of HTTPS as a more secure version of the normal websites you visit; your
overall experience won't change, and Internet providers will still be able to
see that you're on a particular site, but they will see less about what you're
doing there. Try forcing your browser to use the HTTPS version of a site if
there is one. Chrome users, for example, can do this by installing this
extension from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

What does the legislation mean for the government's ability to spy on me?
The measure doesn't give the government any more powers to gather information
on people than it already had, although with ISPs getting into the data-mining
business, LeBlanc said, that's another place government officials could
theoretically go to find information about people of interest.
“I don't see any prohibitions on government as a market actor bidding for your
personal data,” he said. LeBlanc added that even foreign governments could
conceivably buy data from ISPs to find out about people they're interested in.
There is some precedent for this. In fact, in 2013 the New York Times reported
that the CIA had paid AT&T for records relating to its customers' phone calls.
But gathering information this way may be less efficient than certain
“If the FBI wants information from AT&T, they're going to get it the way they
always have,” he said, “which is to send them a subpoena or a warrant.”
That's not to say law enforcement officials don't or won't find consumers'
Internet data useful. What's likely to happen, Calabrese added, is that the new
information ISPs collect on their users may find their way into databases that
government officials are already mining. And that's how the government could
President Trump approved a repeal of FCC rules that protect consumers' online
data from their Internet providers. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)
