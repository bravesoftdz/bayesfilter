Fancy a Formula 1 car at a knock-down price? Get one in failed Manor Racing's
Manor Racing Manor Racing skidded into administration at the start of the year 
Entire Formula 1 racing cars, spare parts for them and testing equipment are
going under the hammer as administrators try to salvage as much as they can
Assets from Manor GP and Just Racing Services - the companies behind the
Formula 1 racing team which crashed into administration three months ago after
two disappointing seasons’ racing - will being auctioned off in May.
The sale of more than 4,000 lots is being billed by administrators FRP Advisory
as a “great opportunity” for other racing teams to pick up equipment, or for
motorsport enthusiasts to buy “unique F1 memorabilia”.
Items for sale include steering wheels form the cars
In January the 200-plus staff involved in the operating the Banbury-based team
were called in to be told that talks with a potential new investor had failed
Manor Racing competed in the 2015 and 2016 seasons of racing, securing a single
constructors’ championship point, with a 10th place finish in the Austrian
Team owner Stephen Fitzpatrick told staff in a letter that had the team’s fate
was effectively sealed in the Brazilian race last year when fellow
back-of-the-grid team Sauber finished ahead of Manor.
This placed Sauber higher in the championship and in a position where it got a
multi-million cash injection from the sport’s authorities.
Cars raced by the team will also go under the hammer
“For much of the season we were on track [for 10th place],” Mr Fitzpatrick
wrote. "But the dramatic race in Brazil ended our hopes of this result and
ultimately brought into doubt the team's ability to race in 2017.”
Assets being sold during the four-day online auction by liquidators Gordon
Brothers include rolling chassis, pit lane equipment, wind tunnel models and
car body parts and components including tubs, front and rear wings, engine
covers and side pods, together with steering wheels and wheel rims.
Also under the hammer are team branded clothing and two huge “pop-up” road
trailers the team used as their operations centre at every Grand Prix.
