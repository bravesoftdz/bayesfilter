But by now the flags may not be red white and blue at all – and are likely to be ‘disintegrating’, Science Alert reports.
Five out of the six flags are still standing, or at least they were in 2012 images captured by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.
The last one was knocked over by the exhaust of the Apollo capsule taking off, according to Buzz Alrdrin.
But the flags will have suffered the effects of five decades in the relentless, shadeless UV rays of the sun – and the extreme temperatures of the moon.

One day on the moon lasts for 28 days – and there is no atmosphere to absorb the UV rays of the sun.
Lunar scientist Paul Spudis wrote in 2011, ‘For forty-odd years, the flags have been exposed to the full fury of the Moon’s environment – alternating 14 days of searing sunlight and 100° C heat with 14 days of numbing-cold -150° C darkness.
But even more damaging is the intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the pure unfiltered sunlight on the cloth from which the Apollo flags were made.
