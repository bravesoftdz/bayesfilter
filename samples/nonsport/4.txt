Gordon Ramsay's father-in-law has pleaded guilty to conspiring to hack a computer system relating to the celebrity chef's business interests.
Christopher Hutcheson, 68, and his sons Adam, 46, and Christopher, 37, admitted plotting to unlawfully access Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited's system.
His daughter Orlanda Butland, aged 45, denied the same charge.
The prosecution accepted the pleas at London's Old Bailey and offered no evidence in relation to Ms Butland.
Hutcheson Snr is the father of Ramsay's wife, Tana.
The charges relate to a plot to hack into the computer system at the firm, between 23 October 2010 and 31 March, 2011.
Hutcheson Snr was charged under Operation Tuleta, which began in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.
