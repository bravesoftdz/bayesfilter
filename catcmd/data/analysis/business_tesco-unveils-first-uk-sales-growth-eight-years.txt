Tesco has claimed that its turnaround plan is ahead of schedule after unveiling
its first rise in UK sales for seven years while profits have broken through
Dave Lewis, chief executive, said that the results delivered fresh evidence
that Britain's biggest retailer was "completely focused and committed" to
reviving its UK business, in a move to allay concerns that its £3.7bn Booker

lengthy investigation into the accounting scandal in 2014 that dragged Tesco
In the UK, like-for-like sales climbed by 0.9pc - the first annual growth since
2009. Mr Lewis said that the UK performance had been driven by its own fresh
food with its so-called "Farm brands" now featuring in two thirds of customer
Mr Lewis said that despite pressures from rising commodity costs and the weaker
pound, Tesco was determined to keep shop prices low and it was "passing less
inflation into the market than any of our competitors".
The supermarket boss said that after a sustained period of deflation, inflation
was tracking at around 0.5pc during the company's final quarter but shoppers'
baskets were still 6pc cheaper than two years ago. 
"The last place we would go is to consider raising prices, we would only do
that after exhausting every other option," said Mr Lewis.
Last year Tesco pulled Unilever's products, which includes Marmite, Pot Noodles

Tesco's international business, which includes shops in the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Thailand and Malaysia, reported flat operating
profits of £320m while like-for-like sales were up by 1.3pc.
Analysts have recently suggested that Tesco's acquisition of Booker, which
would enlarged the UK presence, could pave the way to the superstore chain

"We have said the review of our international business is over... the
speculation is just that, nothing more," the Tesco boss said. It has already
Tesco announced in January that it would buy FTSE 250-listed Booker, the
cash-and-carry wholesaler and foodservice business, which has 5,400 franchise
shops under the Budgens, Londis and Premier brands. 
Mr Lewis stressed that the primary rationale of Booker deal would be that it
could access the "fast-growing out of home" food market, where the company
supplies thousands of restaurants, including Wagamamas and Carluccios and
businesses including Vue Cinemas and prisons across England and Wales. 
Two of Tesco largest shareholders, Artisan and Schroders, have criticised the
deal as being a "foolhardy" expensive distraction from the supermarket's core
However, the Tesco chief executive said that "Booker and the opportunity it
presents is one that sets us up for the future and my job is to look ahead to

deal lies in providing a growth engine for Tesco in the restaurant and hotels

industry experts believe will require the supermarket to offload hundreds of
its Tesco Express convenience shops or its One Stop chain. Mr Lewis said that
he anticipated the deal closing in late 2017 or early 2018.
Ray Gaul, vice president of retail insights at Kantar, commented: "Tesco's
management will spend considerable time, money, and political know-how to
convince authorities and rebellious shareholders that the merger is good for
the British public and healthy market competition."
