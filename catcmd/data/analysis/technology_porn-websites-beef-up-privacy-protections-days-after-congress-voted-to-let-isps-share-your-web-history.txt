As you may have heard, Congress recently voted to repeal Internet privacy
protections that otherwise would have gone into effect later this year. The
move effectively permits Internet providers such as Verizon and AT&T to
mine and sell your browsing history, location information, and in some cases
even the content of your communications, similar to what Google and Facebook do
Even when it is not tied directly to a name, certain types of data can shed
light on a person's medical history, financial details, even their sexual
preferences. Even the type of porn sites a person visits can be revealing.
[The House just voted to wipe out the FCC's landmark Internet privacy
In an announcement Thursday, the website Pornhub — which claims to get 75
million visitors per day — said it has adopted HTTPS, a security measure that
adds encryption to a site to guard visitors against snooping and attack. Its
sister site, YouPorn, will also be adding HTTPS on April 4, according to parent
“With the switch to HTTPS, we are able to protect identity as well as safeguard
them against exposure to malware by third parties,” said Corey Price, a vice
president at Pornhub. The move by Pornhub has been months in the making.
"Privacy is paramount to us – it always has been," Price added. "With HTTPS,
users can rest assured that their browsing data is encrypted, not visible to
anyone and, therefore, cannot be sold. While this transition … was in the works
Here's what that means in practice. Visitors to these sites should see a green
padlock icon in their browser's URL bar, a sign they are viewing the secured
version of the site. Privacy experts say HTTPS helps prevent third parties —
such as your Internet provider — from seeing more detailed information. While
HTTPS doesn't prevent an Internet provider from recording a visit to a site
like Pornhub, in practice it keeps providers from knowing which specific videos
visitors may have watched, category links they may have clicked
“If you go to an HTTPS website with a little lock, the arc of visibility of an
ISP is much diminished,” said Chris Calabrese, a policy executive at the Center
[What to expect now that Internet providers can collect and sell your Web
Sites without HTTPS support — pornographic or otherwise — don't provide these
Internet users can force their browsers to view the secure version of any site 
(if there is one) with certain software extensions.
On the heels of the congressional vote, some Americans are wondering again how
to shield their online activity from outside view. Although many sites still
lack support for HTTPS, more are opting to do so — including The Washington
Post. For a list of sites that are HTTPS-compatible, check out this list from
