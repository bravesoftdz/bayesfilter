Cyber attacks knock millions off FTSE share prices
FTSE 100 A large cyber attack knocks 1.8pc off a company's share price on
FTSE 100 companies that suffer serious cyber attacks risk taking a £120m hit to
their market value, according to the first study to establish a link between
Oxford Economics, which studied 65 severe breaches at listed companies, found
that they tend to lead to share prices falling by an average of 1.8pc.
The report, commissioned by the IT giant CGI, also found that investors had
started punishing companies more harshly for cyber attacks in recent years.
While disclosing a hack in 2013 would have led to a 0.2pc share price fall, by
The research follows a string of high-profile attacks on companies including
TalkTalk, Yahoo and Tesco Bank. Yahoo, which revealed last year that more than
1bn accounts had been compromised, was forced to cut the price of its $4.8bn
(£3.9bn) sale to Verizon by $350m earlier this year.
Oxford Economics compared the long-term effect of a company hit by a “severe”
or “catastrophic” data breach, as defined by Gemalto, a company that tracks
cyber attacks. It found that over a week, a hacked company’s share price would
fall by an average of 1.8pc compared to its peers - roughly £120m for a FTSE
“The markets are now starting to become aware that a cyber attack destroys
value in the company,” said Andrew Rogoyski, head of cyber security at CGI. “We
are beginning to see City analysts, venture capital firms and credit ratings
agencies factor cyber security readiness into the way they assess firms.”
A new European data protection regime is due to come into force in May of next
year that will force companies to disclose more cyber attacks and give
regulators the power to enforce much higher fines than the current £500,000.
The General Data Protection Regulation, which is being adopted in the UK
despite plans to leave the EU, will mean companies facing a fine of up to €20m
