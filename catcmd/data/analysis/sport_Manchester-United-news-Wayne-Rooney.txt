In the hours and days after the curtain comes down on Manchester United's
season on May 21, Wayne Rooney will have life-changing choices to make.
Offers are being readied from across the globe. Interest remains in China,
America and here in England. There are decisions to deliberate.
A move away from Old Trafford is deemed likely at this stage given Rooney has
played just 232 minutes of football since his record-breaking day in Stoke.

Then, with a stunning stoppage-time free-kick to edge ahead of Sir Bobby
Charlton's goalscoring milestone, Rooney looked like he was enjoying his game
It was a moment of genius, a moment to tell those circling that quality still
rests in his right boot. Yet time in a red shirt has been fleeting since and,
with just 10 games left of United's first campaign under Mourinho, it appears
supporters will only catch a mere glimpse of him before the end of May.
Rooney has been left bitterly disappointed at failing to prove his fitness
ahead of Thursday night's Europa League quarter-final against Anderlecht,
instead sitting in his Cheshire home to see whether United will gain an

Niggling injuries have been his undoing in recent weeks, the knee and ankle
problems still giving the 32-year-old difficulty despite training this week.
And that Rooney's influence has waned quite so significantly since goal No 250
It is understood he will consider a package from boyhood club Everton this
summer, but there are other Premier League sides monitoring his situation as
well. That Rooney will be playing abroad next season is by no means cut and

Long-standing former team-mate Ryan Giggs told Sportsmail that Rooney is driven
'Wayne wants to play football,' Giggs said. 'He's always one you drag off the
training ground. He used to go mad when Sir Alex (Ferguson) rested him.
'It's where he's going to play. When you get to your 30s, you look to the end.
He's still got plenty of time left. Wayne's not the sort of person where you
can go in and out like I could when I was older. Some need to play all the
'It's whatever makes him happy and still challenge him. It'd be nice to see him
stay in the Premier League. Maybe he wants a change of lifestyle, or culture.
His £300,000-a-week wages might well present an issue for the likes of Everton,
whose interest is confirmed, as well as other top-flight clubs. No such hurdles
for those in China, so it will be intriguing to see where he ends up.

For now, though, Rooney will be on the periphery during United's final few
matches of this season. He looked focused at training on Wednesday, determined
to put his knee through enough strenuous work to make him feel ready.
Not enough to make the plane, however, and Mourinho indicated it could well be
the second leg or even a trip to Burnley on April 23 before he comes back into
'He's not confident, he's not happy, he has bad feelings with his ankle and is

Mourinho has asked his stars to play through the pain, so that Rooney did not

Say it was Burnley when the England international did come back. That leaves
just seven fixtures left on the calendar - with Manchester City, Arsenal and
Rooney has not started against a top-four rival since September and his chances
of making a tangible impact on United's run-in are dwindling with each passing
