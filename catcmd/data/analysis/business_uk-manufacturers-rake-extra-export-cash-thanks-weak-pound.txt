UK manufacturers rake in extra export cash thanks to weak pound

British car manufacturers are benefitting from the weak pound to the tune of
hundreds of millions of pounds per month, as new figures show foreign sales are
generating higher revenues once translated into sterling.
Exports now account for a bigger share of turnover for UK car and trailer
companies, reversing the traditional position in which the domestic market was
Average monthly export revenues in the past six months stood at £3.4bn,
according to the Office for National Statistics, up 16pc on the £2.9bn average
By contrast domestic turnover held steady at £3bn.
This is largely due to the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote last June,
which has pushed up the prices exporters receive for their goods by 9.3pc
compared with February of 2016. Domestic prices are up by a much more modest
At the same time the effective exchange rate is down 10.7pc, with rising export
The rise in domestic prices matches an uptick in wider inflation as the cost of
imported goods - and some of the components used by manufacturers - increases,
“The recent increase in domestic prices may therefore be the result of
manufacturers raising their domestic prices to compensate for rising input
It comes as consumer price inflation held steady at 2.3pc in the 12 months to
March, a level that is above the Bank of England’s 2pc target and is up sharply
on the 0.8pc inflation in the previous 12-month period.
The improvement in export turnover matches predictions from the Bank of
England’s deputy governor Ben Broadbent, who said companies may end up banking
bigger profits as overseas sales generate higher revenues, rather than taking
the chance to cut prices and compete harder abroad.
However, he also said the current situation may represent an economic “sweet
spot” as the currency has fallen in anticipation of more difficult post-Brexit
trading conditions - but as the UK has not left the EU yet, businesses have not
As a result, Mr Broadbent expects that if Brexit does not inflict the damage
that currency markets fear, then the pound will rise again and the benefit to
exporters will diminish. On the other hand, if leaving the EU does make
international trade more expensive, then those costs will absorb the gains made
