Employment hit a new record high in February as companies kept on hiring
workers, and moved more part-time staff into full-time jobs to meet the demands
Pay growth disappointed, however, just as inflation picks up, so rising prices

A total of 1.56m people were unemployed from December to February, down by
45,000 on the previous three-month period and down by 141,000 on the year.
