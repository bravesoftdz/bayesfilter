Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has finally completed his
troubled, protracted sale of AC Milan to a Chinese-led consortium and thanked
Berlusconi said he left the club with 'pain and emotion' but said he needed to
sell in order for the club to compete at the highest level.
Milan enjoyed their most successful years under Berlusconi after he took over
in February 1986, including winning eight league titles and five European Cups

The tortuously long winded deal began last summer. It was thought a consortium

Instead, the club has been taken over by Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux -
previously known as Sino-Europe Sports, with promises of returning AC Milan to
Since winning the Scudetto in 2011, Milan have slipped into mid-table,
finishing eighth, 10th and seventh in the last three seasons.
Previous owner Silvio Berlusconi, who was in charge for over 30 years, had
limited his monetary input as he looked to sell. Now he has done so, a newly
moneyed Milan - and similarly rich rivals Inter - could next season finally
In a statement on the club website he said: 'I leave today, after more than 30
'I do so with pain and emotion, but with the knowledge that the modern game, to
compete at the highest European and world levels, needs investment and
resources that a single family is no longer able to support.
'I will never forget the emotions that Milan has been able to give and give to
all of us. I will never forget all the people thanks to whom I had the
privilege of presiding over the club that has won so much.'
Berlusconi said it  would be impossible to name all the individual players and
coaches he wished to thank, but instead offered them all 'a big group hug'.
He said:  'But above all, my thanks from the bottom of my heart goes out to our
fans. To the millions of fans who filled stadiums around the world to shout

them, we won everything he could win. I have in my mind and heart a thousand

The deal, said to be worth £627.5million, was finalised on Thursday and
The deal, the biggest Chinese investment in a European club, follows retail
giant Suning Commerce Group's purchase of Milan's rival Inter last year. A
Chinese firm also owns the media rights to Serie A.
In a statement published on the AC Milan website, Berlusconi's family holding
Fininvest said it had sold its entire 99.93 percent stake in the club to
The deal had been provisionally agreed on August 5, but persistent problems
meant that the takeover was not completed officially for another eight months.
The new owners have also agreed to take on Milan's debts, which the statement
said are worth around £186.5million. The statement also confirmed the new board
Milan are currently sixth in Serie A, 10 points off the Champions League
The 18-time Scudetto winners and seven time European champions have fallen on
comparatively hard times in recent seasons as Berlusconi limited his investment
in the team - they have not qualified for European football in the last three
