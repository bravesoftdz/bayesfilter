Tony Adams emerges from the shadows with a kindred spirit hoping he can lead
Now 50, the former Arsenal captain is the surprise choice to lead the Spanish
strugglers to safety by Chinese owner Jiang Lizhang
[662x372a_3]Tony Adams has taken charge at Granada thanks to the club's Chinese
Spanish side Granada turning to Tony Adams in their quest to secure La Liga
safety, on the face of it, is a shock move, particularly considering the
ex-England defender’s relative lack of managerial experience.
Nevertheless, the former Arsenal captain has taken over as head coach of the
Andalusian side after they elected to sack Lucas Alcaraz.
Alcaraz was the Spanish side’s second manager of the season, having replaced
Paco Jemez in October after the ex-Rayo boss had overseen the club’s worst
But Alcaraz proved unable to turn things around at the club, winning just four
league games. El Grana have the second worst defence in the division, the
second worst attack and the joint-worst goal difference. Seven points from
safety, with just seven games left, their six year stay in the Primera Division
looks set to end, unless something spectacular occurs at Los Carmenes.
On Monday morning, Alcaraz was dismissed by the club’s Chinese owner, Jiang
Lizhang following the club’s home defeat by Valencia. Alcaraz’s appointment had
been met with widespread derision at the time, and his 137th loss in 271 games
  • Arsenal legend Tony Adams handed the reins at La Liga strugglers Granada
"After evaluating the situation that the team was in and the feeling around the
team after the last few results, Granada has decided to end the reign of Lucas
Alcaraz and his back room staff,” declared a club statement.
"In his place, the club puts all its confidence in Tony Adams, vice-president
of DDMC, as first-team coach of Granada until the end of the season.”
But, below the surface, Adams move into the role of head coach shouldn’t come

Lizhang became the club’s first foreign president after purchasing the club
last June in a -L-32million deal from the Pozzo family, current owners of
Watford and Udinese and with whom he has a number of other dealings.
Born in the Chinese province of Fuijan - “from a humble family” as he told
Granada’s fans in an open letter when taking over last June - Lizhang is the
general manager of sports management company DDMC, founder of sports marketing
company Double-Edge Sports, a part-owner in NBA side Minnesota Timberwolves,
the biggest stakeholder in Belgian side OHL and owner of Chinese Super League
His ownership of the latter has already been felt in Spain, with the Spanish
side having taken Adrian Ramos on loan in January. The Colombian striker joined
on a temporary deal, after Lifan fronted the cash to sign him from Borussia
Dortmund in an -L-8million deal. He has scored twice in nine games and will

Adams managerial career has been less than stellar. He spent less a year as
manager Wycombe - overseeing a relegation - and spent 15 games in charge of
Portsmouth winning just twice. Eighteen months were then spent at Azerbaijan
side Gabala, finishing seventh in his only full season, before he elected to
Adams would however return, joining as director of football under the
stewardship of owner Tale Heydarov, a graduate from the London School of
Economics who also holds a Master’s degree in International Security and Global
Governance. Adams was given “total control” over football matters, building the
It was that work, over six years in Azerbaijan, which saw Adams last summer
look once more to coaching. He sent a video to Lizhang detailing his work at
Lizhang, having taken control at Granada, wanted to hire the 50-year-old, as
manager of the Spanish side there and then. However, reckoning he needed
someone who knew the league, he elected to go with the popular Jemez, who,
despite walking away from Rayo Vallecano after relegation last year had earned
a strong reputation for fast-attacking football on a shoestring budget.
The timing was deemed wrong. But keen to align himself with Adams, Lizhang made

"I met the Chinese owner of Chongqing Lifan," Adams told CGTN (China Global
Television Network). "But I made a mistake. I sent him a video of my projects
in Azerbaijan. And he said, ah, you built a club, you built a club in
"Come and build a club for me, come and be a sports director.”
Adams spent five months in Chongqing, as sports director and head of the club's
youth academy and was named vice-president of DMCC. After the 2016 season
finished in November, Adams moved to Spain to evaluate the club’s
In February, sporting director Javier Torralbo was dismissed - criticised for a
club structure that saw 106 players on the club’s books across all levels, but
with only 44 actually belonging to Granada - at which point “everything related
to football” fell into the lap of Adams, including the task of finding a new

That task remains, but now he will also take charge of Granada’s final seven
games of the campaign, starting against Celta Vigo on Sunday. Fixtures at
Sevilla and Real Sociedad, as well as a visit from European champions Real
There will be no settling in period for a man who won four English titles and
three FA Cups with Arsenal, as he looks to guide a squad featuring 17 loan
players. He will also be forced to answer questions over his knowledge
concerning Spanish football, at a time when some pundits question why English
managers don’t get handed more opportunities in his homeland and are highly
critical of clubs who elect to go foreign - witness Adams’ former Arsenal
teammate Paul Merson and his comments after Marco Silva’s arrival at Hull City.
“I believe that with patience, the structure we are setting in place will be
able to take the club where we want it to be, once more,” said Adams last week.
“We want to be a mid-table team in La Liga with players who belong to Granada
CF, with a world class academy developing local and Spanish players, with world
“All these things will take time, as sometimes you need to take one step back
and clear up all the problems, before you can take two steps forward.”
Bar a minor miracle, the club will be taking a major step back when the club
drops into the Segunda Division in May. The question will then turn to whether
Adams remains in place or slides back into football’s shadows.
