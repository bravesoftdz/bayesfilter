Airlines across the world appear to be engaged in a race to the bottom when it

It has become apparent that America’s airlines, much like America’s president,
have absolutely no shame. They seem to care only about profit and treat the
people they supposedly serve like chattel, cattle or criminals.
This week’s installment of airlines reaching new lows is brought to you by
United – you know, the people who spend tens of millions of dollars on fancy
adverts urging you to “Fly the Friendly Skies”, while seemingly going out of
their way to make the skies as unfriendly as possible.
The story has been everywhere over the last 24 hours and you’ve probably seen
the graphic video. United overbooked a flight and, having only realized this
after the flight had boarded, tried to force a few randomly selected passengers
off. One man refused to vacate the seat he paid for and, thus, had a reasonable
expectation of sitting in. Security officers dragged the 69-year-old
grandfather off the plane screaming. This was all caught on video and went
You’d think that United might have balked at this PR disaster and issued a
groveling apology. Particularly as the incident comes hot on the heels of last
month’s controversy around United denying boarding to two teenage girls because
The furore was followed by perhaps the most half-assed sorry-not-sorry in the
history of corporate apologies, with United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz expressing
regret for “having to re-accommodate these customers”. Yes, that’s right, they
translated “dragged a man out of a plane screaming” into “re-accommodate”.

Somewhere, in the depths of United HQ, there is a team of copywriters tasked
with systematically wringing any actual meaning out of the English language and
transforming it into hollow, hyphenated platitudes.
But, really, is anyone actually surprised at United’s lack of compunction?
Thanks to deregulation and industry consolidation, the power relationship
between airlines and customers is dramatically skewed in airlines’ favour.
Carriers can basically do whatever they like and get away with it. After all,
Short of boycotting flying altogether there’s basically no way for customers to
hold airlines to account. So we just hand them our money and grin and bear it.
We expect airlines to be awful. And low expectations are lucrative; while
airlines like to cry poor to justify incessant cost-cutting, last year global
The industry-wide of practice of overbooking, which the United episode brought
to light, is just one example of the airline industry’s hubris at work. In
theory, overbooking should be good for everyone. It ensures that more seats are
full and should help drive ticket prices down. However, there aren’t enough
regulations in place to protect customers from overbooking, which means
airlines can deny boarding to passengers without offering adequate
United offered passengers $800 to get off the plane before it brought in the
security guards. Federal law in America means it could have gone up to $1,350
but no further. Surely there should be a minimum cap on compensation due to
While airlines across the world appear to be engaged in a race to the bottom
when it comes to customer experience, it is America’s airlines which stand out
as exceptionally awful. The enormous amount of consolidation in the American
airline industry means that there is very little competition. Brands that try
to compete on customer experience rarely last long. Indeed, Alaska Airlines
recently announced it was killing off the Virgin America brand earlier this
Over the last few years the Gulf Carriers – Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and
Emirates – have been making inroads into the American market. These airlines
put more of an emphasis on customer service and the threat of competition has
caused much uproar amongst the big American carriers.
Rather than attempting to better their own service and compete in that regard,
however, American airlines have been looking to their government to try and
stifle competition – claiming that they can’t possibly compete with Gulf
In February the CEOs of American Airlines, United and Delta asked to meet with
secretary of state Rex Tillerson to discuss “the massive subsidization of three
state-owned Gulf carriers – Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates – and
the significant harm this subsidized competition is causing to US airlines and
Weirdly, shortly after this demand for a meeting, the US Department of Homeland
Security announced a ban on electronics larger than a mobile phone which
targeted 10 Middle Eastern airports and nine airlines – including the major
Gulf carriers which American carriers are so outraged by.
There have been accusations that this is simply a roundabout way of stifling
competition rather than furthering national security. And, indeed, the
electronics ban does appear to achieve very little in terms of national
security. If you’re committed enough to turn your Kindle into a bomb you’ll
probably also be able to figure out that you can still take said Kindle on a
The latest United debacle is unlikely to be the last time airlines hit the news
for appalling behavior. For far too long airlines have been allowed to treat
their customers in a way no other business would be allowed to get away with.
It’s time that passengers demand more regulation and show airlines that this
