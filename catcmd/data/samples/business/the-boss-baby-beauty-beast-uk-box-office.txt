The Boss Baby makes a dummy of UK box-office competition
Aggressive previews strategy allows The Boss Baby to hold off Beauty and the
Beast in the family-film arena, while good weather kills off more mature

While glorious sunshine at the weekend created very tough conditions for cinema
operators across the UK, the Easter school holiday delivered up an audience for
titles with a clear family positioning. DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby
posted £2.8m for the weekend period, just ahead of Beauty and the Beast’s
£2.76m. However, a very aggressive previews strategy meant that The Boss Baby
added takings from the preceding six days (1-6 April), essentially creating a
nine-day opening “weekend” figure of £8.03m. In the same nine-day period,

Beauty and the Beast’s total now stands at a towering £58.5m, making it the
14th biggest hit of all time at the UK box office, ahead of titles including
Casino Royale and The Dark Knight Rises, as well as six of the eight Harry
Peppa Pig: My First Cinema Experience rounds out the top three, with a UK
opening of £1.05m. The film’s title suggests that this is the first big-screen
outing for the reliably profitable piglet; however, Peppa Pig: The Golden Boots
debuted at UK cinemas in February 2015 with £687,000, on its way to a total of
£2.33m. Both films are episode compilations – all exclusive and new in the case
Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman on Going in Style: ‘People have to be taken
While families seem by and large to have stuck with planned cinema outings at
the weekend, adults stayed away in droves, with big drops for titles such as
Ghost in the Shell, Jake Gyllenhaal sci-fi Life and Ben Wheatley’s
trigger-happy Free Fire. Among new releases, audiences were thin for old-geezer
comedy Going in Style, starring Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin –
opening tally was a not-so-stylish £569,000 from 454 cinemas. The Anna Kendrick
wedding comedy Table 19 opened ignominiously in 12th place, with £131,000 from
The indie battle: A Quiet Passion v Raw v I Am Not Your Negro
Three very different films battled to be crowned king of the arthouses at the
weekend, with honours pretty even. Ignoring previews from consideration, only a
few thousand pounds separated the weekend totals of Raul Peck’s historical
documentary I Am Not Your Negro (£54,600), Terence Davies’ Emily Dickinson
biopic A Quiet Passion (£52,100) and Julia Ducournau’s sexy French horror Raw
(£48,800). I Am Not Your Negro, on the fewest screens among the trio, achieved
Raw: watch a clip from the feminist cannibal horror film
Also fighting for a piece of the action was the Chilean biopic Neruda, from
Jackie director Pablo Larraín – the film debuted with £28,400 from 26 cinemas.
Contemporary London crime drama City of Tiny Lights was the emphatic loser of
this week’s crop of indie flicks, with £15,700 from 57 cinemas for the weekend
period. A big problem it faced: indie cinemas, its natural home, had plenty of
other titles to choose from, and audiences were always unlikely to find it in
multiplexes. The sunshine then sealed the fate for the picture, which stars Riz
One film that wasn’t at all affected by the sun was Secret Cinema’s
presentation of Moulin Rouge! The event is essentially sold out every day, so
takings barely fluctuate week to week – the latest session was up 2% at
£202,000, for an eight-week total of £2.53m. The run for this event was
initially scheduled to end after 11 weeks on 30 April, but it has now been
extended by another six weeks to 11 June. This edition of Secret Cinema looks
headed for a final gross north of £5m, which compares with £18.5m for the
Despite the strong sunshine, takings matched the previous frame (a modest 4%
rise, in fact), although that’s really all down to those whopping Boss Baby
previews inflating the numbers – strip them out, and you’d see a significant
drop. Takings are also 33% up on the equivalent session from 2016, when The
Huntsman: Winter’s War debuted at the top spot. Expect another big cash win for
cinemas with the arrival on Wednesday 12 April of The Fate of the Furious.
