US government drops effort to unmask anti-Trump Twitter account

  • Government seeks to unmask Trump dissident on Twitter, lawsuit reveals

The US government has backed down from its attempt to unmask an anonymous
Twitter account that criticized the Trump administration, a victory for free
Just one day after Twitter sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to
block its effort to gain identifying information about an anonymous account,
@ALT_USCIS, attorneys from the justice department contacted Twitter to inform
them that the disputed summons had been withdrawn.

The withdrawal obviated the need for the suit, and Twitter filed to voluntarily
The government’s climbdown was seen as a victory by free speech advocates, who
had reacted with outrage to the revelation that government officials were
“This confirms that it was really ridiculous that this request got filed in the
first place,” said Andrew Crocker, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a civil liberties organization. “It’s good to see that it went away
Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy & Technology Project,
tweeted: “Looks like someone wasn’t so eager to see us in court ...” The ACLU
had planned to represent the anonymous Twitter user in court.
“Speaking anonymously about issues of the day is a longstanding American
tradition, dating back to when the framers of the constitution wrote under
pseudonyms,” the ACLU attorney Esha Bhandari said in a statement. “The
anonymity that the first amendment guarantees is often most essential when
people criticize the government, and this free speech right is as important
    We want to thank @twitter and @aclu for standing up for the right of free
    anonymous speech. Thank you resistance for standing up for us. https://t.co
Twitter’s original complaint, filed Thursday, revealed that Customs and Border
Protection (CBP), a division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), had
issued a summons to Twitter on 14 March seeking the phone number, mailing
addresses, and IP addresses associated with @ALT_USCIS.
That account is one of dozens of “alternative” Twitter accounts that have
sprung up since Trump’s inauguration. The accounts purport to express the views
of dissenting civil servants within various federal agencies, but they are

The account @ALT_USCIS, whose handle refers to US Citizenship and Immigration
Services, regularly criticizes Trump’s immigration policy, including the push
for a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and the proposed
In seeking identifying information about the account, agents from CBP cited a
federal law that relates to importing merchandise.
News of CBP’s summons raised a red flag for freedom of speech and privacy
advocates. Senator Ron Wyden called for an investigation by the DHS inspector
general “to determine who directed this witch hunt”.
In a letter to CBP’s acting commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, on Friday, Wyden,
who is the ranking member of the Senate finance committee, reiterated his
request for an internal investigation “including whether the decision involved
Wyden wrote that he was concerned by the possibility that CBP requested the
information in order to determine whether the anonymous user was a DHS employee
and, if so, “take retaliatory action or otherwise squelch the exercise of first
“If that is the case, it raises serious concerns regarding potential violations
of law that must be promptly addressed by CBP,” he wrote.
DHS declined to comment on the case Thursday, citing a policy not to comment on
pending litigation. On Friday, CBP declined to comment on a list of questions
regarding how and by whom the summons was crafted and approved.
Those unanswered questions, combined with the president’s ongoing hostility to
both the press and his critics, continue to raise concerns for free speech
“The anonymous account holder is safe, for now,” said Jennifer Granick, the
director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.
“Perhaps the Department of Justice has learned a lesson. Perhaps the Trump
administration may try to find the poster another way, for example by
Jamie Lee Williams, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
said: “The fact that they withdrew the summons doesn’t necessarily show that
the new administration recognizes the importance of [anonymous] speech.
“I think they just recognized that they were going to lose.”
