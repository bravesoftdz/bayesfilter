All Carter Wilkerson wanted was some free chicken nuggets – now he has one of

The 16-year-old’s request for a year’s supply of chicken nuggets from American
fast food chain Wendy’s has been retweeted more than 2.2m times – making it the
third most popular tweet of all time, and the most popular of 2017 so far.
To put this in perspective, Ellen DeGeneres currently holds the record for the
most retweeted tweet ever. Her star-studded Oscars-night selfie has held the
record since 2014, with 3.4m retweets. In second place is One Direction’s Louis
Tomlinson with a tweet dedicated to bandmate Harry Styles that scored 2.4m
retweets, knocking Barack Obama’s “four more years” tweet (900,000+ retweets)
This is the internet, so we wouldn’t rule out shenanigans just yet, but
nugget-lover Wilkerson seems to be legitimate. He did not respond to the
Guardian’s request for comment, but spoke to USA Today last week. The teenager
from Nevada said the whole thing started as a joke.
    Next time I eat these they better be free @Wendys pic.twitter.com/
He said: “I sent out the tweet as a joke, but then they responded with the
“I thought ‘Consider it done’ would be funny among my friend group. Then I put
the screenshot up and it started gaining momentum.”
His father, J Wilkerson, told USA Today they had talked about perhaps donating
the year’s supply of nuggets. He added: “My wife and I think it’s great if it
has a great cause other than eating chicken nuggets for a year. It would be
great to solve a life crisis. But also it’s nice to have some whimsical news.”
But how did a random tweet from a teen about nuggets get so big? The answer
Wendy’s has become known on the internet for its irreverent attitude on
Twitter. In January, its uncorporate-like tweets were noticed by the press
after it had a mini Twitter war about fresh ingredients:

Wendy’s VP of advertising Brandon Rhoten told Mashable in January: “The intent
of the social media team is to represent the brand’s voice as best as they can.
“When folks say, ‘roast me,’ we’re going to have fun with that.”
The Wendy’s social media team, whose Twitter account has 1.61m followers, ran
with the whole thing, exposing the tweet to a wider audience via Twitter’s

They also retweeted celebrities who’d endorsed #NuggsforCarter.

And naturally, the whole thing has become the talk of Twitter.
Whether Wilkerson will succeed in his quest is another matter. Twitter says it
has 313m active monthly users. To reach 18m retweets, he will have to be
retweeted by about 5.7% of Twitter’s active users.
What happens next? Well, Wendy’s has yet to respond beyond eye emojis. They
also did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.
There’s also a strong likelihood he and a representative from Wendy’s (perhaps
even the person who sent the 18m tweet) will end up on Ellen DeGeneres’s show,
which regularly features viral stars. After all, Wilkerson’s tweet could well
