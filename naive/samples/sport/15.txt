Great Britain have named an all-changed men's team for the European Gymnastics Championships in Romania.

None of the Rio Olympians - including medallists Max Whitlock, Louis Smith and Nile Wilson - are included.

Instead 2012 Olympic medallist Sam Oldham returns, while first-year senior Joe Fraser makes his international debut, as does Dom Cunningham.

Courtney Tulloch, James Hall and Frank Baines complete the men's line-up with the women's team announced Wednesday.

Men's head coach Eddie van Hoof said: "As the first European Championship of the new Olympic cycle this competition gives the unknown a chance to become known.

"Our British team members are relatively young and inexperienced in such events and this affords them the exposure to compete against Europe's best and measure their progress.

"There are a number of medal opportunities for the taking."

Rio Olympians Whitlock, Smith and Kristian Thomas are taking a break from competition.

Wilson is injured while Brinn Bevan is the other Rio member absent.

The event in Cluj-Napoca runs from 19-23 April and is the first international competition for the GB team since their best ever Olympic haul of seven medals in Rio.
