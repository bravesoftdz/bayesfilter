The last thing Ben Landricombe was expecting to see on his way to work was a meteor.

But that's exactly what the 36-year-old, from Plymstock, claims he saw at 6am today.

Ben, a keen photographer, managed to capture the extraordinary sight - and has produced these stunning pictures.

"I've never seen anything like it in my life," said Ben, who works for Plymouth City Council. "I was late to work, but I think my boss was alright.

"I showed everyone the pictures and they all said 'Wow!'".

Did you see this too this morning?

Ben was driving to work from his home on Hooe Road when he spotted something in the air.

Recalling the strange turn of events, he said: "I drove straight back home to get my camera, then I went to the highest point in Plymstock to take the pictures, where the big cross on the hill is.

"I missed the meteor coming through the atmosphere, but I saw the sparks coming down, travelling really fast."

Council worker Ben is a keen photographer

A supermarket worker claimed he saw a similar sight on New Year's Eve, The Herald reported earlier this year.

Amateur space watcher David Butland, aged 42, says he was standing outside his parents' house in Beacon Park at about 7pm on when he noticed a "yellowish light" in the sky, passing from south to north.

David noticed a 'yellowish' light in the sky

"I kept watching it and it started growing and changing colour," David said.

"About 10 seconds before it disappeared it started burning up, then four or five fragments broke off it.

"Originally the colour was mainly white, but as it started to break up it turned into a tint of yellow then deep yellow as more pieces broke off.

"It came from the south, flew over and to the side of the house and broke up low and in a northerly direction."
